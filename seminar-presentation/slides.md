# GPGPU
* GPGPU based on Intel's Larrabee
* Schedule tasks via software instead of hardware
* "The aim of this project is to explore the performance of this type of architecture using a cycle accurate hardware model"

# Where I come in

* Some code changes
	* Performance counters
	* Simple stuff
* Run experiments
* Summarize related work

# Thread switching

* Two thread switching strategies
	* Barrel switching
	* Switch on stall

# Rollbacks

* Six causes of rollbacks
* Right now focusing on explaining cache miss rollback in context of barrel vs SoS switching

# Near future

* Sensitivity test on cache associativity

# Learning

* Background as far away from hardware/architecture as possible
* Learning a lot
